# personal-website
Hello! You're looking at a website about meeee (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧

I made this website from scratch, using my knowledge about HTML, CSS and Javascript. On this website, you can find a Home page, an About page, a portfolio and a Contact page, each containing things that the title suggests. My Home page is where I have a photo of me and my ambitions for the world. The About page has a bit more information about me and what I've been through and where I plan to go from there. My portfolio is a showcase of some of my favorite hobbies and things that I am proud of from a non-developer standpoint. And lastly, the Contact page is pretty straightforward: it's a form where you submit information for contact and correspondence.

I am the type to have a different vibe for each page, so each one has a different layout and color scheme (save for Home and the Contact page, which follow the same color scheme). I included photos, supplementary text, as well as audio files to bring my website to life.

This website contains all aforementioned file types: HTML, CSS and JS. 
Hope you enjoy the content!
