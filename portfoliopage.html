            <p>I had taken an art class my sophomore year of college (2017) as a creative outlet, since my STEM classes were very intense and rigorous. It was nice to have a little break in all the craziness. Plus, I LOVE to paint, so naturally this was a the perfect class. This assignment, we had to replicate a painting from a surrealism artist and add our own twist. I had chosen the painting “The Butterfly Apple” by Salvador Dali. He’s one of my favorite painters. My personal twist on my project was my material. I had no black paint, and all the black paint I tried to create DEFINITELY was not black, but rather a very murky and muddy brown, no matter what I tried. Instead, I used my liquid eyeliner and a paint mixing medium and painted with that. My professor and peers were so impressed by my quick thinking and dedication to the project. It’s personally one of my favorite projects to date.

            <p>One of the things that I am majorly interested in is cosmetology, mainly makeup. I take my appearance very seriously, and have made looking good one of my constant rituals (call me vain, I can accept that). I love whimsical, dramatic, colorful, bold makeup and I have showcased some of my favorite looks here. I focus more on my eye makeup here, because that’s the most time-consuming portion of my routine, plus I do the most with my eyes than anything else on the face. I have examples of colorful lashes, graphic eyeliner, festive looks as well as normal eyeshadow. I am continuing to experiment with my looks and find enjoyment in that. I <i>do</i> have a makeup instagram with more of my work on myself and others.

            <p><u>Disclaimer:</u> I made this (very bad) home studio recording when I was 16 years old (so in 2014, this was created) at 3:34AM on a school night. I am only warning you, for if you listen, it sounds like I am whispering and playing my guitar very lightly… which is exactly what’s happening. Also this recording was done on my phone with a shoddy pair of earphones that I used to listen to my music regularly. The song I am singing is also in a different language that I was learning at the time of recording (I’m a lot better on pronunciation now). It’s not pristine, nor star quality, but this song still sits in my heart as one of my favorite raw covers I’ve made. It’s also the last standing demo I have from my SoundCloud era, where I was making actual music. That SC is now deleted (and so are its tracks) because I hated it all, but I am starting to make music again, so maybe this song cover will finally debut. Keep a lookout, mixtape dropping soon!! LOL</p>
