            <h1>More Info</h1>
            <p>
                Born and raised in the Bible Belt of the United States for majority of my life, I grew up with a set of
                values that some would call traditional. Hospitality, compassion, respect and etiquette was something
                that was instilled in me at a young age. Especially because I was born and only child to a single mother
                who worked constantly to make a living for us; she ensured that I was a refined young lady. Not saying
                that I’m not, but I think I was a bit too eccentric in my mannerisms, that my mother and I moved to
                California with my grandparents. I knew I was different and I was absolutely okay with that.</p>

            <p>I’m the type to have my hands in multiple pots of life; variety is one of the major things in life that I
                need to stay focused. My music taste is large and ranges across genres (although my favorite is metal
                and k-pop). I also have hobbies and interests that span as well. I am interested in everything from the
                arts and entertainment, to STEM, to the occult, to sports (I was in gymnastics for 10 years) and even
                food and travel. Being well-rounded is one of the biggest things about me and my personality.</p>

            <p>I went to college in Houston, TX and double majored in Biomedical Engineering and Mathematics with a
                minor in astrophysics (just because I thought it’d be interesting). I have a couple years left, but I
                took a hiatus from university because my mom had stage 4 cancer metatstatic breast cancer. I rushed home
                to take care of her, because I didn’t know just how much time I had left. I spent years with her as she
                beat cancer 2 times after that— she struggled with cancer 4 times total. She’s in remission now and
                begged me to live my own life, so I wanted to go back to school. I enrolled in the Grace Hopper Program
                at Fullstack Academy to kickstart my education again. I’m a self-taught programmer (self-taught like
                most of my skills), and wanted to enhance the information I already know to build a career in tech that
                will not only help me take care of my small little family, but also help me prepare for my future, by
                providing me with the income to pay for my schooling and the knowledge to complete the courses needed to
                follow my dreams.</p>

            <p>Overall, I think I’m pretty okay!! I have lived quite a life so far, at my
                big age of 25, and I thank the Universe for providing me with the opportunities to better myself. Things
                in life do get better (even incrementally), and I am looking forward to the development it has for me.
                Thanks for listening :-).</p>
